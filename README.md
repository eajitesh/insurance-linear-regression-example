# Insurance Linear Regression Model Example

This project aims to predict insurance premiums based on various features like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and geographical region. We use Linear Regression as the machine learning model and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data better. This repository contains all the code, data, and resources used in this project.
